# GaussPET

📝Accurate evaluation of cerebral ischemia relies on metabolic imaging, yet positron emission tomography (PET) is rarely available in primary and resource-limited hospitals due to its cost, radiation exposure, and operational complexity. In such settings, diagnosis predominantly depends on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which primarily reflects structural changes and often fails to reveal early or subtle metabolic abnormalities, leading to diagnostic uncertainty and delayed clinical decision-making. We propose GaussPET, an interpretable MRI-to-PET synthesis framework designed to provide PET-equivalent metabolic information from routine MRI alone. Instead of modeling cross-modal translation as a highly nonlinear black-box process, GaussPET is grounded in the observation that local intensity variations between MRI and PET exhibit stable, physiologically meaningful linear relationships. MRI-to-PET generation is therefore formulated as a structured linear transformation, complemented by a Gauss–Seidel iterative scheme that enforces bidirectional consistency through auxiliary PET-to-MRI reconstruction, enhancing numerical stability and metabolic plausibility. Experiments on 303 patients with cerebral ischemia show that GaussPET consistently outperforms state-of-the-art generative methods across multiple quantitative metrics. Regional analyses across nine cerebral vascular territories demonstrate strong agreement with real PET, while hypometabolic region derived from synthesized PET preserve clinically relevant correlations with NIHSS and mRS scores. By enabling noninvasive metabolic assessment without additional scanning time or radioactive tracers, GaussPET offers a practical solution to the functional imaging gap in primary hospitals, supporting more reliable ischemia evaluation in resource-constrained clinical environments.

Overview of the proposed model. The model comprises a primary forward pathway for MRI-to-PET synthesis and an auxiliary inverse pathway for PET-to-MRI reconstruction, where the latter serves as a regularizer to encourage the forward synthesis to retain MRI-consistent physiological structures.
